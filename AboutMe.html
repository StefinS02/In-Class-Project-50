        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>My name is Stefin Shaji, and I am 15 years old. I live in Australia and attend Broughton Anglican College.<br>
        My favourite school in school is ISTEM and mathematics. My hobbies are to play basketball tennis and bike riding.<br>
        I go bike riding about 4 days every week with some of my friends who live within my neighbourhood.<br>
        When I have a bit of free time, I go outside with some friends within my neighbourhood and go and play several<br>
        different things. When I grow older, I would like to be some sort of engineer. I like to help people during times when<br>
        they are struggling the most. I like to learn coding and I am certified as a game developer and now I am learning to be an<br>
        app developer. I have learnt to make games using p5.js, p5. play and matter.js in JavaScript. I would learn how to use the<br>
        softwares, code.org and visual studio code.</p>
